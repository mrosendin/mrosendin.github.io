I am the founder of [Trustline](https://trustline.co) where I'm building a cryptocurrency payments app. Previously, I worked at a company called [Ripple Labs](https://ripple.com) where I help financial institutions integrate software cross-border payments. I also created a cryptocurrency portfolio management app called [Polyledger](https://github.com/polyledger) and before that, I worked as a developer at [Zendesk](https://zendesk.com).
