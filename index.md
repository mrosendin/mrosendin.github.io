### About Me

I work at a company called [Ripple](https://ripple.com) where I help our customers integrate our products that enable the future of cross-border payments. Previously, I created a cryptocurrency portfolio management app called [Polyledger](https://polyledger.com) and before that, I worked as a developer at [Zendesk](https://zendesk.com). In my free time, I like to contribute to open-source code, study the Italian language, and golf.
